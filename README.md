# 247-game-surfer

Built with React Native and Typescript.  Powered by Cheap Shark API and IGDB API.

24/7 Game Surfer is an app that allows the user to surf video game deals from many store fronts in one convenient place.  It allows the user to navigate directly to the game store to purchase the game, as well as provides a game details page that displays all the info about the game.  Cover photo, description, screenshots and even videos.  

You can also favorite any game you see and it will be added to your favorites screen.  You can hop right into your favorites screen and purchase your games from there or remove them if you change your mind.  I hope you enjoy!

It's not ready for release but you can have a sneek peek by watching the private youtube link below :)
